/**
 * Act 2 (Demo) — the scripted fake meeting that plays through Métis's REAL Bar/Copilot/Answer
 * components (see components/OnboardingDemoScene.tsx), replacing the old static mock card (MQA-277).
 * Per the Vibe-Island teardown's boxed pattern ("drive the real UI with fake data... never a video"),
 * this module is the "fake data" half: a pure, DOM-free projection of one meeting's worth of scripted
 * beats onto a single `elapsedMs` clock, in the same spirit as lib/scramble.ts's `scrambleFrame` — the
 * logic that actually matters lives here and is fully unit-tested; the component only measures pixels
 * and drives a rAF/timeout clock over it (a bug there is a wiring bug, not a logic bug).
 *
 * SAFETY (MQA-278): this module has NO dependency on the IPC bridge, the renderer's shared state module,
 * or the live listen engine — it cannot read a real transcript, a real session, or any other real app
 * state, and it cannot call a real save/ingest IPC. Its only inputs are the constants below and a plain
 * number (elapsed milliseconds); its only output is inert data (strings/booleans) for the demo scene to
 * render. That is what makes "a real in-progress meeting can never leak into the demo" true by
 * construction rather than by a runtime check — there is simply no code path here through which real
 * data could arrive. A contract test (onboarding-demo.mqa277.test.ts) pins this by asserting the source
 * never references those symbols, so a future edit that tries to wire real state in fails a test
 * instead of silently opening the hole.
